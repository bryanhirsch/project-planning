<h3 id="product-goals">Product goals</h3>

*Product goals* are program-level goals. Goals are usually non-technical. These answer the questions like:

 - What is this tool for?
 - Why is it worth investing time and resources in this?
 - How will we measure our success?


---

<h3 id="product-roadmap">Product roadmap</h3>

The *product roadmap* charts a course for where the product is headed as features and functionality evolve. Major changes in user experience or technical functionality correspond with major "versions" on the roadmap.

Before beginning and throughout work on a new version, it's important to clarify and prioritize must-have versus nice-to-have features. The roadmap communicates to product owners and developers how the team should prioritize ongoing feature development.

<h3 id="feature-roadmaps">Feature roadmaps</h3>

Each new feature identified in the product roadmap should correspond with a *feature roadmap*. Feature roadmaps include:

 - *milestones* are a sequence of critical benchmarks on the path to approving a feature as "complete" (these should be listed clearly somewhere, with a clear indication of status, e.g. not started, in progress, complete)
 - *user stories* describe specific examples of end-users interacting with the new thing build developed; user stories should be written in the language of product owners (ideally by product owners, if not, approved by product owners); user stories should give developers clear sense of "commanders intent"
 - *requirements*, any requirements that are not obvious from the user stories should be surfaced here
